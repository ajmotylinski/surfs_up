# Overview 
Our client raised questions regarding the feasability of running a surf and ice cream shop year round. It is assumed that the weather could be a proxy to determine the success of the business. The analysis will look at two months, June and December, to compare the differences in weather in these two months. These months were selected because June is projected to be the peak month and December is expected to be the lowest month.

# Results
The completed analysis showed that the average temperature as expected was lower in December than June. The average December temperature is 71 degrees while June has a average of 75 degrees.  The larger variance observed is the lowest temperature experienced each month. The lowest temp in December is 56 degrees and in June is is 64. Even though these are the extremes, it would be good to understand how the business performs at these temps. The maximum temperature for June is 85 degrees and the December maximum is only 2 degrees lower at 83 degrees. The standard deviation of temperatures in Decembers is 3.75 while in June it is only 3.25. This can be translated to less variability in June temperatures than December.

As a result of the analysis, the surf and beach shop is a feasible year round endevour. One suggestion for the business is to tailor the merchandise based on the season. As December approaches, I would suggest that the shop invest in wetsuits to keep the surfers warm. In addition, the ice cream shop may want to ensure that they have coffee or other hot beverages available. This doesn't take much space but could help offset any lower sales in ice cream.
